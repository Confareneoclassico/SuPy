Tutorials
==================================

To familiarise users with SuPy urban climate modelling and to demonstrate the functionality of SuPy, we provide the following tutorials in `Jupyter notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`_:

They can run in browsers (desktop, mobile) either by easy local configuration or on remote servers with pre-set environments (e.g., `Google Colaboratory <https://colab.research.google.com>`_, `Microsoft Azure Notebooks <https://notebooks.azure.com>`_). In addition, Jupyter notebooks allow great shareability by incorporating source code and detailed notes in one place, which helps users to organise their computation work.

Jupyter notebooks can be installed with pip on any desktop/server system and open .ipynb notebook files locally:

.. code-block:: shell

    python3 -m pip install jupyter -U
