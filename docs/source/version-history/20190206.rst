Version 2019.2.6 (released on 06 Feb 2019)
======================================================

This is a release that fixes recent bugs found in SUEWS that
may lead to abnormal simulation results of storage heat flux,
in particular when `SnowUse` is enabled (i.e., `snowuse=1`).

- **New**

  None.

- **Improvement**

  Improved the performance in loading
  initial model state from a large number of grids (>1k)


- **Changes**

  Updated `SampleRun` dataset by:
  1. setting surface fractions (`sfr`) to a more realistic value based on London KCL case;
  2. enabling snow module (`snowuse=1`).


- **Fix**

  Fixed a bug in the calculation of storage heat flux.

- **Known issue**

  None
